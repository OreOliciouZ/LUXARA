## üöÄ AutoMod Quick Start Guide

LUXARA allows you to control Discord's AutoMod feature directly with commands. Here's how to set it up:

1.  **Set a Log Channel:** You must first tell the bot where to send moderation alerts. This is a one-time setup.
    *   `/config-logs set-channel channel:#your-mod-log-channel`

2.  **Configure Your Rules:** Now you can use the `/automod` command group to manage your filters.
    *   **Block custom words:** `/automod keyword add word:badword1,badword2`
    *   **Enable a preset:** `/automod preset toggle rule:Profanity enabled:True`
    *   **Add a timeout penalty:** `/automod set-timeout rule:Keyword duration:5` (Adds a 5-minute timeout for anyone who uses a custom keyword).
