# Terms of Service for Missing Stars

**Last Updated:** June 27, 2025

By inviting or using **Missing Stars** ("the Bot") in your Discord server, you and all server members who interact with the Bot's features agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"), in addition to Discord's own Terms of Service.

## 1. Description of Service

The Bot provides a range of features including, but not limited to, server moderation, a multifaceted economy game, user utilities, automatic translation, and entertainment commands. Features may be added, changed, or removed at any time at the discretion of the developer without prior notice. The service is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis.

## 2. Rules of Conduct

You agree not to use the Bot for any of the following purposes:
- To engage in any activity that violates Discord's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.
- To abuse, exploit, or attempt to reverse-engineer any command or system (e.g., finding loopholes in the economy).
- To utilize macros, user-bots, scripts, or any other form of automation to interact with the Bot's commands to gain an unfair advantage.
- To conduct fraudulent activities, such as scamming users through the `/gift` or `/pay` commands.
- To spam commands or otherwise trigger automated bot responses in a way that disrupts the experience for other users or degrades the Bot's performance.

Violation of these rules may result in a permanent ban from using the Bot.

## 3. Termination of Service

We reserve the right to prohibit any user or server from using the Bot at any time, for any reason, without notice. This action is at the sole discretion of the Bot's creator, `oreoliciouz`, and is typically reserved for violations of these Terms or to protect the operational integrity of the Bot.

## 4. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Bot is provided "as is," and we make no warranties, express or implied, that the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or free from errors. We are not responsible for any loss of data, such as virtual currency or items, that may occur due to technical issues or other unforeseen circumstances.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the creator of Missing Stars be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the Bot. This includes, but is not limited to, damages for loss of virtual goods or in-game status.

## 6. Contact

For any questions regarding these Terms, please join our official **[Support Server](https://discord.gg/asRaJG9zCc)** and contact a staff member.
