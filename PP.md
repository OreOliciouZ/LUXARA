# Privacy Policy for Missing Stars

**Last Updated:** June 27, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage it when you use **Missing Stars** ("the Bot").

## 1. What Data We Store

To provide its services, the Bot stores the following data in its database:

-   **User ID:** Your unique Discord ID is stored as the primary identifier for your economy data and moderation history. This is necessary for the bot to remember your balance, items, and warnings.
-   **Guild (Server) ID:** We store the server ID to manage server-specific configurations (such as welcome messages, logging channels, and translation settings) and to ensure warnings are specific to that server.
-   **Moderator ID:** When a warning is issued, we store the User ID of the moderator who issued it for accountability.
-   **Economy & Game Data:** We store your wallet/bank balances, item inventories, and command cooldowns to make the economy game function correctly.

## 2. Third-Party Data Processing

To provide specific features, certain data may be sent to third-party services for processing.

-   **Translation:** To provide the automatic translation feature, the content of messages detected as being in a foreign language is sent to **Google Translate** for processing. The Bot itself **does not store** the content of these messages in its database.

## 3. Data Storage & Security

The Bot and its database are hosted on **Discloud**. We take reasonable measures to secure your data from unauthorized access, but please be aware that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 4. Your Rights and Data Deletion

You have the right to request the complete deletion of your user-specific data (your economy profile and warning history). To do so, please join our official **[Support Server](https://discord.gg/asRaJG9zCc)** and contact a staff member.

## 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us in our **[Support Server](https://discord.gg/asRaJG9zCc)**.
