# Privacy Policy for Missing Stars

**Last Updated:** June 26, 2025

This Privacy Policy details the information **Missing Stars** ("the Bot") collects, the purpose of collecting it, and how your data is handled. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to being transparent about our data practices.

## 1. What Data We Collect and Why

To provide its services, the Bot stores data necessary for its core functionality. The data we collect is explicitly tied to actions you take while using the Bot.

-   **User ID:** Your unique Discord ID is the primary identifier for your profile. We use it to store and manage your economy data (wallet, bank, items), command cooldowns, and moderation history (`/warn`). This is essential for the Bot to remember you across sessions.
-   **Guild (Server) ID:** We store the server ID to manage server-specific configurations. This includes custom welcome/goodbye messages, log channel settings, ticket system configurations, and server-specific warnings.
-   **Channel IDs:** We store channel IDs for specific features like the welcome channel, moderation logs, ticket panel, and transcript channels to ensure the Bot sends messages to the correct place.
-   **Role IDs:** For the ticket system, we store the IDs of designated support roles to manage permissions.
-   **Moderator ID:** When a moderation action (like a `/warn`) is issued, we store the User ID of the responsible moderator for logging and accountability purposes.

We **do not** store any personally identifiable information (PII) like your email address, and we **do not** have access to or store message content, except where it is temporarily processed for a command (e.g., Auto-Moderation).

## 2. Data Storage & Security

All collected data is stored in a database. The Bot and its database are hosted on a secure, private server. We take all reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## 3. Third-Party API Services

The Bot utilizes third-party APIs for some of its fun commands (`/joke`, `/meme`). We do not send any of your personal data (like your User ID or Guild ID) to these services. The requests are anonymous and are only used to fetch content to display within Discord.

## 4. Your Rights and Data Deletion

You have the right to request the complete deletion of your user-specific data from our database. This action is permanent and will erase your entire economy profile (levels, XP, balance, inventory) and any moderation history associated with your User ID.

To request data deletion, please join our official **[Support Server](https://discord.gg/asRaJG9zCc)** and make a formal request with a staff member in the appropriate channel.

## 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy, please join our **[Support Server](https://discord.gg/asRaJG9zCc)** to get in touch with the development team.
